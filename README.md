This is a basic crawler meant to save information on stocks provided by the Yahoo Finance website. To use, please save the stock tickers in the stocks.csv file. When the script has finished running, the results will be saved into a new file called info.csv. Finally, make sure that you pip install selenium and download chromedriver from  http://chromedriver.chromium.org and store it in the same directory as the crawler and stocks.csv.
